## 3. CONNECT TEMPLATE PAGES

### Static Instance: `connect/connect.html`

**Purpose:** Shows a CONNECTION between TWO specific apps (displays Cliniko + Stripe as default/example)

### Server-Side Template: `connect/servlettemplateconnect.html`
**Title:** `Connect {TEMPLATE_FROM_APP} to {TEMPLATE_TO_APP} with APIANT`
**Purpose:** Backend servlet replaces placeholders with real app names/icons/endpoint data to generate unique SEO pages for every app-to-app combination.

**Template placeholders:** `{TEMPLATE_FROM_APP}`, `{TEMPLATE_TO_APP}`, `{TEMPLATE_FROM_ICON}`, `{TEMPLATE_TO_ICON}`, `{TEMPLATE_APP1_TRIGGERS}`, `{TEMPLATE_APP1_TRIGGERS_COUNT}`, `{TEMPLATE_APP1_ACTIONS}`, `{TEMPLATE_APP1_ACTIONS_COUNT}`, `{TEMPLATE_APP2_TRIGGERS}`, `{TEMPLATE_APP2_TRIGGERS_COUNT}`, `{TEMPLATE_APP2_ACTIONS}`, `{TEMPLATE_APP2_ACTIONS_COUNT}`

### Sections (both files share):
- Hero with two app icons connected by arrow, "Build API Apps with [App1] and [App2] Without Writing Code"
- CTAs: "Start Building Free" and "Talk to Sales"
- "What is an API App?" info card

**Template placeholders:** `{TEMPLATE_APP_NAME}`, `{TEMPLATE_APP_ICON}`, `{TEMPLATE_APP_TRIGGERS}`, `{TEMPLATE_APP_TRIGGERS_COUNT}`, `{TEMPLATE_APP_ACTIONS}`, `{TEMPLATE_APP_ACTIONS_COUNT}`

### Key Difference from Connect Pages:
- Single app icon (no connect arrow, no second app)

- Only 2 endpoint sections (triggers + actions for one app) instead of 4
- AI Agents section is VISIBLE (hidden on connect pages)
